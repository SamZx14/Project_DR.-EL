# Dr. El: A Web-Based Personal Allergy Tracking and Analysis System
## Abstract

Allergic reactions are highly individualized and often influenced by a combination of dietary, environmental, and temporal factors. Identifying specific allergy triggers remains challenging for individuals due to the lack of accessible, continuous tracking tools. This paper presents Dr. El, a web-based personal allergy tracking and analysis system designed to assist users in identifying potential allergy triggers through structured data logging and visual analytics. The system enables users to record daily allergy-related information and provides interactive heatmap visualizations to reveal patterns and trends over time.

## Introduction

Allergies affect a significant portion of the global population and can substantially impact quality of life. Traditional allergy diagnosis methods often rely on clinical testing or user recollection, which may not capture long-term patterns or contextual factors such as time of exposure or environmental conditions. There is a growing need for lightweight, user-driven systems that support continuous monitoring and pattern discovery without medical hardware.

Dr. El addresses this gap by offering a web-based solution that allows individuals to systematically record allergy-related events and explore correlations between triggers and symptoms using visual analysis.

## System Overview

Dr. El is implemented as a fully web-based application. Users input daily records including food consumption, location, time of day, experienced symptoms such as itching, swelling, sneezing, or breathing difficulty, and reaction severity measured on a defined scale. Additional contextual data such as weather conditions and personal notes can also be included.

The backend processes collected entries and transforms them into structured datasets suitable for visualization and analysis.

## Data Visualization and Analysis

A central feature of Dr. El is its use of interactive, color-coded heatmaps to represent allergy patterns. Heatmaps are generated across multiple analytical dimensions, including food items, geographic locations, time of day, and seasonal or monthly variations. Higher color intensity corresponds to increased reaction frequency or severity, allowing users to quickly identify potential triggers.

The system also provides trigger ranking based on aggregated severity and occurrence frequency. Additionally, week-over-week trend analysis highlights changes in symptom intensity, enabling users to observe improvement or deterioration over time.

## Applications and Use Cases

Dr. El is particularly suitable for academic demonstrations, research prototypes, and hackathon environments due to its visual clarity, ease of use, and real-world relevance. While not intended as a medical diagnostic tool, the system supports informed self-observation and data-driven discussion between users and healthcare professionals.

## Conclusion

Dr. El demonstrates how structured personal data collection combined with visual analytics can support allergy awareness and trigger identification. By removing the need for specialized equipment and focusing on intuitive visualization, the system provides an accessible approach to long-term allergy tracking and analysis.
